## Cloud Native (Previous Class Review)
1. CI/CD  
2. Devops  
3. Microservices  
4. Containers  

**Backend/Server side languages**  
PHP, Python, Javascript, C#  

**Frontend/Client side**  
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular, React, VUE  

Monolithic architecture is a unified architecture.  
Microservices break the client and server side into distribured architecture and smaller modular services which can be developed and deployed independently  

When server and client are separated then client and server communicate over API  
 XML/JSON (APIs)  

Facebook API Example  
	AUTH >> fb.com/auth/login /signup (these are two APIs)  
	POST >> fb.com/get/posts  

## How an API is called    
client: username/password > API > Server   
Server > Success/fail   
Success >> Dashboard  
Failure >> show error  

## Webpage 

Browse a webpage and right click --> inspect element   
See the details from network tab and review different APIs  
  
## Linux Introduction  
See Linux Book shared on Slack  
See Slides

su <-- used for user switching  
cd / <-- navigate to root directory  
cd <-- navigate to user directory  
ls <-- list directory
